    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of RAG is to take information and pass it to an LLM so it can generate outputs based on that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieval - Find relevant information given a query, e.g. \"what are the macronutrients and what do they do?\" -> retrieves passages of text related to the macronutrients from a nutrition textbook.\n",
    "* Augmented - We want to take the relevant information and augment our input (prompt) to an LLM with that relevant information.\n",
    "* Generation - Take the first two steps and pass them to an LLM for generative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to read where RAG came from, see the paper from Facebook AI: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
    "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
    "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
    "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
    "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outputs of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prevent hallucinations - LLMs are incredibly good at generating good *looking* text, however, this text doesn't mean that it's factual. RAG can help LLMs generate information based on relevant passages that are factual.\n",
    "2. Work with custom data - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale data. This means they have a fairly good understanding of language in general. However, it also does a lot of their responses can be generic in nature. RAG helps to create specific responses based on specific documents (e.g. your own companies customer support documents). "

    "\n",
    "* Customer support Q&A chat - Treat your existing customer support documents as a resource and when a customer asks a question, you could have a retrieval system, retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\".\n",

Athletes  from Hawai‘i and across the world paddle from the island of Molokai  to Oahu in the Ka‘iwi Channel, whose name carries the meanings  of its two core words “the bones.” The channel is said to be one of  the most treacherous  bodies of water and depending on the ocean  conditions top paddlers finish between 3 1/2 and 6 hours. Paddlers  spend hours and hours each week training to physically prepare  their bodies and minds for the race but equally important is the  refueling that takes place off the water. Each paddler will say they  have their own “secret” training nutrition plan which may consist of  a specific food or drink they prefer, but the bottom line is that the  energy from carbohydrates, protein, and fat they ingest is required  to fuel their body for training, recovering and repairing so they are  able to continue to perform at high levels. Having a nutrition plan  for race day is equally important for achieving peak performance  and there are all sorts of products available with claims about  digestibility,  energy-sustenance,  and  promises  of  optimal  performance results. Even with all of these highly specified and  formulated products many paddlers prefer to rely on what fueled  Native Hawaiians and other ancient voyager, poi. Poi, made of  watered down pa‘i‘ai or mashed kalo (taro) was considered a  voyaging staple and for many paddlers it continues to be.

    "\n",
    "There is no 100% correct way to do this.\n",

    "We'll keep it simple and split into groups of 10 sentences (however, you could also try 5, 7, 8, whatever you like).\n",

    "Why we do this:\n",
    "1. So our texts are easier to filter (smaller groups of text can be easier to inspect that large passages of text).\n",
    "2. So our text chunks can fit into our embedding model context window (e.g. 384 tokens as a limit).\n",
    "3. So our contexts passed to an LLM can be more specific and focused."

As more alcohol is ingested, this stimulates the production of acetaldehyde by both the alcohol dehydrogenase and MEOS systems. As the levels of acetaldehyde increase inside the liver cells with heavy consumption of alcohol, some of the acetaldehyde diffuse into the blood circulation. In circulation, high levels of acetaldehyde cause nausea and vomiting. Vomiting causes more body dehydration and loss of electrolytes. If the dehydration becomes severe enough, this can impair brain function and a person may lose consciousness. Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of intoxication.',\n",

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to promote health and prevent disease. How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need? The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults at 130 grams per day.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and 65 percent of your total caloric daily intake.

According to the IOM not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less of total calories consumed.

      "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",

      "Example 2:\n",
      "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
      "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 3:\n",
      "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
      "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

A nutrient’s metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance. In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure. Some of these factors are under your control and others are not.

This set point can also be called a fat-stat or lipostat, meaning the brain senses body fatness and triggers changes in energy intake or expenditure to maintain body fatness within a target range. Some believe that this theory provides an explanation as to why after dieting, most people return to their original weight not long after stopping the diet. Another theory is referred to as the “settling” point system, which takes into account (more so than the “set-point” theory) the contribution of the obesogenic environment to weight gain. In this model, the reservoir 492 | Factors Affecting Energy Expenditure\n",

Calories In Versus Calories Out UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM The ability to estimate energy expenditure and quantify calories consumed, has led to the simple conclusion that tracking or counting “calories in” compared to “calories out” will result in an easy way to manage body weight. This logic does not take into account the complexity and individuality of the human body. Human bodies are not static, meaning there are fluctuations from day to day in energy needs related to set point, sleep patterns, stress levels, activity levels, and eating patterns. Something as simple as the timing and macronutrient composition of meals, will impact the thermic effect of food, resulting in a change in energy expenditure.

    "\\nExample 1:\n",
    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

      "Energy balance plays a key role in weight management. It is the state in which the energy intake is equal to the energy expended by the body. When you are in a positive energy balance, the excess nutrient energy will be stored or used to grow. When you are in a negative energy balance, your body will need to use its stores to provide energy. Weight can be thought of as a whole body estimate of energy balance.\n",

This section will provide you with information on how to determine the recommended amount of protein for you, and your many choices in designing an optimal diet with high-quality protein sources. How Much Protein Does a Person Need in Their Diet? The recommendations set by the IOM for the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) and AMDR for protein for different age groups are listed in Table 6.2 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Protein”. A Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for protein has not been set, but it is recommended that you do not exceed the upper end of the AMDR.

Published 2002. Accessed November 22, 2017.  Tips for Using the Dietary Reference Intakes to Plan Your Diet You can use the DRIs to help assess and plan your diet. Keep in mind when evaluating your nutritional intake that the values established have been devised with an ample safety margin and should be used as guidance for optimal intakes. Also, the values are meant to assess and plan average intake over time; that is, you don’t need to meet these recommendations every single day—meeting them on average over several days is sufficient.

Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids. Institute of Medicine. September 5, 2002. Accessed September 28, 2017. Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then transported to the kidneys for excretion.',\n",

The UL is the highest level at which you can consume a nutrient without it being too much—as nutrient intake increases beyond the UL, the risk of health problems resulting from that nutrient increases.

Health and Medicine Division. http://nationalacademies.org/HMD/ Activities/Nutrition/SummaryDRIs/DRI-Tables.aspx. Accessed November 22, 2017. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is the calculated range of how much energy from carbohydrates, fats, and protein is recommended for a healthy diet adequate of the essential nutrients and is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease. The ranges listed in Table 12.1 “Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) For Various Age Groups” allows individuals to personalize their diets taking into consideration that different subgroups in a population often require different requirements. The DRI committee recommends using the midpoint of the AMDRs as an approach to focus on moderation2.',\n",
